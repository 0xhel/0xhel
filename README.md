  bio: "Hi, I'm hel ! 🐧

A Linux lover ( I use Arch btw ) and an undisputed Vim fan. I also enjoy ricing my Linux setup to make my terminal look fabulous. I write code in C, Go, Node.js, JS/TS, Bash, and dabble in React, MongoDB, Cloudinary, Firebase… basically anything that makes my terminal happy.

When I'm not debugging life, I'm probably convincing my cat to approve my commits or arguing with syntax errors. 🐱",
